Powered by [Electron.js](https://electronjs.org).

## Building From Source

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm (installation instructions at <https://nodejs.org>).
- Git (<https://git-scm.com>).
- I ran this repo using VS Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com>). But it's not necessary, since you can run it through npm scripts.

### Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/ChayimFriedman2/electron-painter.git`

### Install the dependencies

`npm install`

### Run the app

If you have VS Code, simply press Ctrl/Command+F5 or go to Debug->Start Without Debugging.

If not, run `npm start` in the terminal.
